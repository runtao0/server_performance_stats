# server_performance_stats
## Practice bash scripting project

### Inspiration/Guide
Using [roadmap.io DevOps roadmap "Server Performance States" guided project](https://roadmap.sh/projects/server-stats)

### MVP Requirements (from website)
* Total CPU usage
iostat vs mpstat - mpstat seemed to be used in more examples I saw online, but I was not able to successfully download that package. I checked alternatives for Macs and found iostat, which came preinstalled. This might not be compatible with all linux.

* Total memory usage (Free vs Used including percentage)

* Total disk usage (Free vs Used including percentage)

* Top 5 processes by CPU usage

* Top 5 processes by memory usage

### Personal Stretch Goals
Response time?
formatting?
organization of bash scripts?
user input to define outputs?
Uptime, response time, error rates, etc.
